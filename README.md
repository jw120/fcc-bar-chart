# FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization: Bar-chart exercise

Simple d3 exercise. Uses GDP data set suggested by the exercise:
[`GDP-data.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json)
(either by downloading it when run or falling back to a local version if tjhe load fails)

Uses d3-tip. Not migrated to d3 v4 as d3-tip seems not to support v4.

Written with ES6 which is compiled with buble and linted with ESLint.
