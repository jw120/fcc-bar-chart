# FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization: Bar-chart exercise

Simple d3 exercise. Uses GDP data set suggested by the exercise:
[`GDP-data.json`]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json

Implemented with ESlint

Uses d3 v3 and d3-tip (which seems to not support v4).

## TODO

* Tidy readme
* Can we migrate to v4? (Does d3-tip work?) (How about typings?)
* Compile to ES5
* TypeScript?
